## Using My Music

For non-commercial purposes, you can use any of my piano covers with permission. If you create a cover of my arrangement, you'll also need to obtain a license from the song's copyright owner. If you're using my original work and adding significant creative elements, feel free to do so! I'd love to see the results. Please credit me and provide a link back to the original video. You can reach out to me via direct message or email.

For further details on permitted usage, please refer to the [Terms of Use](/terms).

## My Tools

I use REAPER as my digital audio workstation (DAW), MuseScore for sheet music notation and engraving, and Piano VFX for creating MIDI visualization videos. I'm open to trying new software if I find something I prefer.

## My Plugins

Currently, I use EastWest Quantum Leaps Pianos Yamaha C7. In previous videos, I used a Kontakt library called Alicia's Keys. I also use OTT for compression, ValhallaVintageVerb for reverb, and ReaLimit for limiting, which is built into REAPER.

## Creating MIDI Visualization Videos

I record piano parts in REAPER, separate the left and right hands into different MIDI tracks, export the MIDI data, and then create a MIDI-visualized video using piano visualizer software.

## Accessing Sheet Music

You can find a library of my sheet music in my Google Drive folder: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y4Dn_VQdO8w4aek2gbXNKi5w8A9vy7tg?usp=drive_link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Y4Dn_VQdO8w4aek2gbXNKi5w8A9vy7tg?usp=drive_link)

## Upload Schedule

I don't have a fixed upload schedule because I don't always have the time and energy to work every day. I upload whenever I feel inspired.

## Supporting My Work

You can support me through my Ko-fi page: https://ko-fi.com/tastyforreal. If you'd like to go a step further, you can commission a piano transcription by visiting this Google Forms link: https://forms.gle/2NpEP28DKfa9WAGQ6.
